## What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:
   
1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.
2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.
3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.

It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

1. **Render** The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render. 
2. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.
3. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.
